            <h2>1 Nephi 3:7</h2>
            <p>
                7 And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord
                hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall
                prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.

            <p>
                27 And I exhort you to remember these things; for the time speedily cometh that ye shall know that I lie
                not, for ye shall see me at the bar of God; and the Lord God will say unto you: Did I not declare my
                words unto you, which were written by this man, like as one crying from the dead, yea, even as one
                speaking out of the dust?
